ID1 - Data v1 -> Observation, converging to around 0 when training
ID2 - Change window size to see if there are any differences
ID3 - Change the used features to only accelerometers
ID4 - Change the validation split from 0.25 to 0.1
--> Validation around 20% (do not converge greatly), testing accuracy less than 10%
Also tried a lot of other different configuration, fails to improve the convergence of the validation
Basically now, I recollect the data to v2

ID5 - New data, 5 train 1 min test
ID6 - Lower the validation split to 2/9
ID7 - Increase the training data to 9 minute of training data.
ID8 - Even more data.
-- Validation max around 50%, testing accuracy not good as well, best is around 0.7

ID9 - Train with validation split of 1/9
ID10 - Retrain again with validation split of 1/9
ID11 - Reduce window size to 40
ID12- Train with accelerometer
-- Validation converge to max around 100%, testing accuracy around 0.75, train with accelerometer is also fine.

ID13 - Train with LSTM
ID14 - Train with LSTM again
-- Validation also converge to max around 99%, testing accuracy also around 0.7

ID15 - Train with Transformer
ID16 - Train with Transformer
