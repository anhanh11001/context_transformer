# Context Transformer

This project is the implementation of detecting smartphone context using [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) model.
## Detailed Description


Smartphone Context Detection is the task of understanding the surrounding environment where the phone is placed, i.e, its relative locations and it postures using built-in sensors.

#### Transformer
Transformer is a new architecture introduced by the Google Brain team in 2017. Transformer has an encoder-decoder architecture and uses the self-attention mechanism for processing sequential data. Transformer was primarily built for language modelling and translation. However, this model has been shown to outperform other deep learning techniques in other tasks, especially suitable with time-series data like event forecasting, anomaly detection and classification. Hence, this research proposes the use of Transformer architecture in the task of smartphone context detection with IMU sensor data.

#### Goals & motivation
The goal of the project is to answer: 

```
How feasible and efficient is it to use Transformer deep learning model to detect smartphone context?
```


#### Dataset
The dataset is collected in the University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands. The tooling used for this project is built with Android applicataion - [IMU Transformer](https://github.com/anhanh11001/imu_transformer).


#### Experiments
To explain later



#### Results
